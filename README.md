# :memo: **Whiteboard Challenge** :memo:

## What this project is about :woman_technologist: 

I made this repository with the aim of helping people prepare for whiteboard (code) challenges. <br/>
The repo includes some of the most common coding challenges for a junior developer + some of the ones I encountered when applying for my first job. 
- Each .js file is divided into a task
- In each task I break down the task by:
  - 1. Understanding the challenge
  - 2. Reasoning about the challenge - how to tackle it
  - 3. Code (with good comments and self-explanatory names for variables and functions)
