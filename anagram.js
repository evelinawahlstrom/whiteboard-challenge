/*
1. Understand the challenge:
    * Writing a function that check whether or not two strings are anagrams of each other - aka whether or not they contain the exact same letters

    anagram('hello', 'elloh') === true
    anagram ('boy', 'car') === false

2. Reasoning about the challenge:
    * Here it is important to look at each letter, no punctation or anything else
    * Good to turn it to lowerString() for easier comparison

3. Start coding
    * Make comments underneath some lines of code to show that you really understand it
    * Name the constant with self-explanatory names --> you're code is easily read.
